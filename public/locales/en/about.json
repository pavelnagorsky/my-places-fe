  "title": "About the project",
  "description1": "When planning a tourist route sometimes you have to spend a long time collecting data from various sources to compile a list of objects that are worth seeing. And after visiting, there is a desire to share the accumulated impressions. Our website is a universal guide to the country, which is filled out by the users themselves. Our task is to popularize domestic tourism and acquaint people with the beauties of Belarus!",
  "description2": "The site is based on two concepts: a Place and a Review. A Place - is directly a tourist object. A Review - author’s mini-tour of this Place. Registered users have access to the Personal Account, which displays all created places, reviews and their current status with the ability to view and edit. The site supports three languages: Belarusian, Russian, and English. After entering the text in the selected language, all information is automatically translated into other languages of the site.",
  "info": "We invite to take an active part in the content of the project both professional guides and experts of the cultural and historical heritage of Belarus, and just indifferent people who love their country. Let’s do it together!",

In the future, the Place/Review can be finalized and sent back to the moderation."

Selected locations are placed into a virtual \"basket\" – a corresponding icon will appear, highlighting the number of selected locations.

Selected locations are placed into a virtual \"basket\" – a corresponding icon appears in the bottom-right corner of the screen. Clicking this icon takes the user to the list of selected locations, with a \"Create Excursion\" button at the bottom. Click it, and you go to the Excursion creation page.\n2.\tIn the Excursion creation window, you need to fill in several fields: a) Title. This is a brief, creative name for the excursion (it is also recommended to briefly list the visited locations in the title). b) Short description. A brief description of the excursion's essence (what we will see, visit, etc.). c) Mode of transportation. Choose one of two options: by car / on foot. d) Type of Excursion. Again, there are two types: Overview (one settlement) / Regional (several different settlements). e) The route itself.\nThe route is formed automatically and can be edited manually: add/remove locations, rearrange their order. A side window shows route details (distance, travel time). Beneath it is the \"Optimize\" button – clicking it reorders the route to minimize the distance (and, correspondingly, travel time). The \"Optimize\" button becomes available when there are 4 or more locations.\nAt the bottom of the page, the visual layout of the Excursion route is displayed on a map.\nFor the route, there are two input fields:\n•\tTime to explore the location (mandatory) – choose from proposed options, in multiples of 15 minutes.\n•\tComments for the route point (optional). This is not the description of the location but an auxiliary comment for the route point. To the left, between route points, travel time (from one point to another) is displayed.\n\nAfter filling out all the fields and forming the route, click \"Save,\" after which the Excursion is sent for moderation. Upon approval, the Excursion becomes visible in the general list of Excursions. In case of rejection, the Excursion is marked as \"Rejected,\" and the reason is sent to the author.

Just below is a button to view Notes for the location.\n\nThe Excursion text – a guide's story – is read from the Short Description of the location + the text of the corresponding Note (Notes).\n\nThe starting and ending points of the Excursion are the first and last points of the route, respectively. Where the user starts and at what time is entirely up to them."
